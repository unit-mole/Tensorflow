# Tensorflow <br>

Welcome to the TensorFlow Repository for CIFA10 and MNIST Datasets! <br>

This repository contains code and instructions for using the TensorFlow machine learning library to train and test models on two popular datasets: CIFA10 and MNIST. <br>

The CIFA10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. <br>

This repository also includes example notebooks for each dataset. These notebooks provide step-by-step instructions for loading and preprocessing the data, defining and training a model, and evaluating the model's performance. <br>
